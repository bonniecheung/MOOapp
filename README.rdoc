A MOO is a text-based adventure game. 

In this MOO, there are five rooms connected to each other with exits.  Each exit has an origin ID and a destination ID, both of which associate it with different rooms by the room's ID.  You navigate from one room to the other by entering a command.  You can go north, east, south, or west.

In traditional MOOs, users are often granted the ability to create rooms and linking exits.  In this app, you have the option to create more rooms by filling out a form.
